Using the TESP
==============

TESP runs on Linux (Ubuntu tested), Mac OS X, and Microsoft Windows.
Installers, source code, examples and documentation are available at
https://github.com/pnnl/tesp/, and the TESP also runs under
Linux at PNNLâ€™s Electricity Infrastructure Operations Center (EIOC) in
Richland, WA. However, we expect that most users would wish to run TESP
on their own computers, which offers the possibility of customization
and also helps to preserve proprietary information that might be
developed or incorporated with TESP. There are two basic levels of
customization, depending whether the user chooses to install or build
TESP:

-  Install TESP: this may require administrator privileges on the target
   computer and supplemental downloads. It will be possible to
   develop new TEAgents and valuation scripts by modifying or
   developing Python, Java or C++ code.

-  Build TESP: in addition to the skill set for installing TESP, users
   should be familiar with configuring environments and using C/C++
   compilers on the target computer. This approach will enable the
   user to develop new TEAgents in C/C++, and to replace or upgrade
   co-simulators (i.e. GridLAB-D, PYPOWER, EnergyPlus) within TESP.
