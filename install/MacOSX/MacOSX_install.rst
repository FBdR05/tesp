Installing on Mac OS X
----------------------

For the time being, no desktop installer is available for Mac OS X.
The technical reason is an apparent binary incompabibility between 
standard runtime libraries that have the same version number. Until this
might be resolved, the choices for TESP usage on Mac OS X are:

1. Use the `Docker Version`_  
2. Install a Linux or Windows version of TESP inside a virtual machine
3. Build TESP on the Mac, see :ref:`BuildingOnMacOSX`

Afterwards:

1. Try the video tutorial at https://github.com/pnnl/tesp/releases
2. Try :ref:`RunExamples` 

.. _`Docker Version`: https://github.com/pnnl/tesp/blob/develop/install/Docker/ReadMe.md
