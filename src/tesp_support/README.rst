Introduction
============

Transactive Energy Simulation Platform (TESP) simulates 
the electric power distribution grid with transactive control
of loads and resources. Current features include:

* GridLAB-D for the distribution system and residential loads
* EnergyPlus for large buildings
* MATPOWER or PYPOWER for the bulk power systems
* Bindings for transactive agents in Python, Java or C++

The goal of TESP is that researchers can focus their work
on the last item, to push advances in the field.

Installation
============

TESP can be installed using pip_::

  $ pip install tesp

In addition, it needs:

* Python 3.5 or later, with Numpy, SciPy_ and PYPOWER
* Custom versions of GridLAB-D and EnergyPlus

Using TESP
